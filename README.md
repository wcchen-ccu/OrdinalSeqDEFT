This is a demo of the density estimation method, **Ordinal SeqDEFT**, published in [Wei-Chia Chen, Juannan Zhou, and David M. McCandlish, Density estimation for ordinal biological sequences and its applications, Phys. Rev. E 110, 044408 (2024)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.044408).

To use it, download everything to a folder. In the same folder, create a directory called `sparse_matrix`. In the directory, create another two directories called `D_kernel_basis` and `Ac`. These directories will be used to store some reusable stuff.
