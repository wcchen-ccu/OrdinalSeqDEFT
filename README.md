This is a demo of the density estimation method, **Ordinal SeqDEFT**, published in [Wei-Chia Chen, Juannan Zhou, and David M. McCandlish, Density estimation for ordinal biological sequences and its applications, arXiv:2404.11228 (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11228).

To use it, download everything to a folder. In the same folder, create a directory called `sparse_matrix`. In the directory, create another two directories called `D_kernel_basis` and `Ac`. These directories will be used to store some reusable stuff.
